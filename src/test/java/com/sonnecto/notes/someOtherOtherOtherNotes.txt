Scenario and Scenario outline:

    Scenario -> similar to @Test in TestNG
             -> combination of steps to test a functionality of the app.
             ->all steps run once and we can pass parameters.

    Scenario Outline:
             -> is mainly used for Data driven testing
             -> used with Examples table where we pass sets of data.
             -> steps in the scenario outline repeat for each row of data in Examples table.
=======================================================================
    Datatable vs Examples table:
        Datatable is used to pass parameters/list of data to a certain step:
            Then students names should be present:
                |Peja|
                |Liki|
                the above steps will accept student names as a List of String.
                That step will run only once and not repeatedly for each student.


        Examples table is used to pass data for the whole scenario and scenario will
            run repeatedly for each row of data.
                When User searches for "<studentID>" in system
                Then students "<name>" should be visible
                Examples:
                    |studentID|name|
                    |100|Peja|
                    |200|Liki|
