How do you re-run the failed tests/scenarios?

Let's say we have 100 tests/scenarios and we executed all of them.
Then you see that 7 of them failed.
Now we want to re-run only the failed test scenarios:

-1) option could be to: identify failed scenarios and add @rerun tag for them and run
        CukesRunner with that tag.
        This is time-consuming and not efficient way. We don't do that.

-2)option could be to run the tests using maven. We can ask maven to re-run the test certain number of times
    if it fails.
                 mvn -Dsurefire.rerunFailingTestCount=1 test
    For the above to work, we need to use maven command line commands to run our tests.

    -Dsurefire.rerunFailingTestCount=1 => is a parameter that we pass,
            1 means reRun the test ONCE if it fails. We can change that number to a different one.


-3) Using Cucumber rerun plugin.
1)Add a "rerun:target/rerun.txt" to our CukesRunner plugins.
    It will collect the failed scenarios into a text file.
2)Add a separate CukesRunner that picks up that file and runs each scenario in that text file:

    public class FailedTestRunner{
        plugin{
            ""
        }
    }

Main CukesRunner will run the tests and collect all failed ones to rerun.txt file.
Then when we run the new FailedTestRunner, it will read rerun.txt file and run only those.

Why rerun a failed test?
    -To make sure that this is an actual app bug, not automation code issue.
        -Let's say for the second time it passes, it might mean our automation code
            needs some updates.
        It might also mean that application is not stable enough.

Purpose is not just to pass the failed tests, it is to see if it repeatedly fails or it will pass next time.
If it repeatedly fails, it means app has a bug, provided that our automation code is correct.

If it fails and then passes, it means: automation code has bugs, sync issues, data corrupted etc.

------------------------
Summary:
    When a test fails, I analyze the reason for the failure.
    I read my framework automation html reports and look at screenshots.
    I try to follow the test steps manually to see if it works manually.
    I also have mechanism in my framework to re-run the fail0.ed tests/scenarios.

    After all the steps above, if it is automation code issue, I will update my test script.
    If it is app issue, I make sure that it's a bug and create a bug report in Jira.

====================================
How do you re-run the failed test scenarios?

    In my CukesRunner, I have a plugin that starts with "rerun:target/rerun.txt".
        So when I execute my scenarios, the failed ones will automatically go to rerun.txt file.
    Then I have a dedicated FailedTestsRunner class to run the scenarios that are in rerun.txt.

    So if I see any failed scenarios, I run the FailedTestsRunner and analyze the results.
    It is useful to make sure that if a test fails, it is indeed a bug and not a script issue.

=======================================================================================================
    How do you do parallel execution of your tests in your framework?

       I use maven surefire plugin to perform multithreaded parallel execution of my tests.

When we have many tests, we can execute them in parallel mode, so multiple tests run at same time.

To support that, we need to change our Driver class. It should have driver pool, instead of single driver.

private static ThreadLocal<WebDriver> driverPool = new ThreadLocal<>();

ThreadLocal<WebDriver> will allow us to open multiple WebDrivers at the same time.

If we have single static WebDriver like before, we will not be able to perform parallel execution.
